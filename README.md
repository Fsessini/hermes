# HERMES - HElicopter Real-time Model for Engineering Simulation. 
This project made me even more passionate about helicopter flight but most importantly it convinced me it is better if I keep studying them instead of trying to fly one. Watch me as I desperately try to hold an hover:\

quite the performance ah?\
Jokes aside, in this personal project I built a non-linear, 9-DoF dynamic model for real-time simulation of conventional configuration helicopters in MATLAB/Simulink. It can be used to perform piloted simulations using a joystick or for control system design and flying qualities evaluation.
