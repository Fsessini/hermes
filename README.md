# HERMES - HElicopter Real-time Model for Engineering Simulation. 
A non-linear, 9-DoF dynamic model for real-time simulation of conventional configuration helicopters developed in MATLAB/Simulink.\
It can be used to perform piloted simulations using a joystick or for control system design and flight qualities evaluation.
